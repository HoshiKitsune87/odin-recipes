<h3>The Takoyaki dish</h3>
<p>Takoyaki is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special molded pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus (tako), tempura scraps (tenkasu), pickled ginger (beni shoga), and
green onion (negi).</p>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Takoyaki oil brush</strong> - This special brush perfectly fits the holes of the takoyaki pan in order to grease and distribute the oil evenly in each hole. If you don't have it, just scrunched kitchen paper towel will do the job.</li>
